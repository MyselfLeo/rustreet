# Rustreet: CLI Map viewer

Everybody has been at least once in this situation:
> "How I'd _love_ to see the map of [_Beaumont-du-Lac, France_](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/407012759), but I'm stuck in my command line ! What can I do ?!"

**Rustreet** is what you need.

Functionnalities:
- [ ] Use [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) to support user-friendly search (such as _"Beaumont-du-Lac, France"_)
- [ ] Display primary roads from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/45.7804/1.8097) in a command-line (Ascii display)
- [ ] Allow movement in the map
- [ ] Change level of detail (residential roads, buildings, etc.) depending on the level of "zoom"

## Known problems
- Diagonal ways are not displayed properly: they use 2 characters by line instead of one, resulting in a less comprehensive visual.
